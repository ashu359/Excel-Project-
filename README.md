🌆 City Climate & Pollution Analysis – Excel Project
📁 Project Overview
This Excel project contains detailed climate and pollution data for 10 major Indian cities across different regions. It includes city profiles (population, area, climate zone) and daily pollution readings (AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, SO₂, O₃) from January to July 2024.

❓ Problem Statement
🌫️ Core Problem
"To analyze and understand how climate zones, regional factors, and seasonal patterns influence air quality variations across major Indian cities, and identify which cities face the most severe pollution challenges based on multiple pollutant parameters."

📊 Data Structure
📑 Sheet 1: City_data
Basic information about each city:

Column	Description
City	Name of the city
Region	Geographic region in India
Population	Approximate population
Area (km²)	Land area of the city
Climate Zone	Type of climate (e.g., Tropical, Semi-Arid)
Cities Included:

Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow

📑 Sheet 2: City pollution data
Daily pollution metrics for each city:

Column	Description
City	City name
Date	Date of recording (YYYY-MM-DD)
AQI	Air Quality Index
PM2.5	Particulate Matter (fine) in µg/m³
PM10	Particulate Matter (coarse) in µg/m³
NO₂	Nitrogen Dioxide in ppb
CO	Carbon Monoxide in ppm
SO₂	Sulfur Dioxide in ppb
O₃	Ozone in ppb
🎯 Key Features
✅ Multi-city data – 10 Indian cities

✅ Daily pollution tracking – 7+ months of data

✅ Multiple pollutants – AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, SO₂, O₃

✅ Climate zone classification – Helps correlate climate with pollution

✅ Regional grouping – North, South, East, West India

🧠 Possible Analysis Ideas
You can use this dataset to:

📈 Compare pollution levels between cities

🌤️ Study the effect of climate zones on air quality

📅 Analyze seasonal pollution trends (Jan–Jul 2024)

🏙️ Relate population density or city area to pollution

🔍 Identify which pollutants are highest in each city

📉 Track AQI changes over time

💡 Example Insights (from a quick glance)
Delhi and Kolkata frequently show high AQI values.

Mumbai and Chennai often have high PM2.5/PM10 levels.

Bengaluru and Hyderabad show moderate pollution levels.

Coastal cities like Mumbai and Chennai have "Tropical" climates, while Delhi is "Semi-Arid".

📌 How to Use This File
Open in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets

Use filters to view data for a specific city or date range

Create charts to visualize trends (e.g., AQI over time)

Use PivotTables to summarize average pollution by city/month

Merge both sheets using VLOOKUP or XLOOKUP for combined analysis
